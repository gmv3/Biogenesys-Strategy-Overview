## About

This Jupyter notebook contains the code for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), as well as exploratory data analysis (EDA). The following tasks are performed here:

- **Data Extraction**: Data is obtained from various sources, such as databases, CSV files, APIs, etc.
-**Data Transformation**: The data is cleaned and transformed to be suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and creating new variables.
- **Data Loading**: The transformed data is stored in a structure suitable for subsequent analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Descriptive analyses are conducted to understand the main characteristics of the data, identify patterns, and detect anomalies. Graphs and descriptive statistics are used for this purpose.
